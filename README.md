TicTacToe - Vue.js Assignment

Welcome to TicTacToe, a fun, colorful, and interactive version of the classic game. This project is built using Vue.js and is intended to demonstrate a practical application of the Vue.js framework, specifically using Vue 3's Composition API.
Features

    Players can select their unique names and colors.
    The game maintains a history of all past games.
    The score is maintained for each player across games.
    Built using Vue.js 3 with the Composition API.

Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
Prerequisites


Install dependencies:

npm install

Run the application in development mode:

    npm run dev

Usage

    Player 1 and Player 2 choose their unique names and colors.
    Players then take turns clicking on an empty square on the grid to place their mark.
    The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
    In case the grid is filled up without any player winning, the game is considered a draw.
    Scores and history of the games are stored locally and are available to view even after reloading the page.
